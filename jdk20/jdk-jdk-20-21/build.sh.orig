and also gnu date, so add DATE=/usr/gnu/bin/date to configure

Setting --with-source-date also breaks copyright year generation which
also needs gnu date.

No need to have a Solaris switch to force fork1(), as of S10 that's
the default behaviour.

Build broken by https://www.illumos.org/issues/14418. That did 2
things -  (1) exposed memcntl and meminfo by default, and (2) changed
the signature for memcntl from caddr_t to void so there's a
mismatch. The fix adopted is to modify the internal java signature for
memcntl to the new version, which still allows builds on older
releases as the old definition in sys/mman.h was effectively invisible
there.

Rename thread_solaris_x86.{c,h}pp -> javaThread_solaris_x86.{c,h}pp
mv thread_solaris_x86.cpp javaThread_solaris_x86.cpp
mv thread_solaris_x86.hpp javaThread_solaris_x86.hpp
sed -i s:_THREAD_:_JAVATHREAD_: javaThread_solaris_x86.hpp
sed -i s:runtime/thread.inline.hpp:runtime/javaThread.hpp:
javaThread_solaris_x86.cpp
and fix up includes in os_solaris.cpp

The checkedNatives stuff now causes compilation failures, so remove it
wholesale.
